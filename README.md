# Getting working with Python
This is our introduction to Python, and in some ways some of this has been setup a bit strangely. I understand if it takes you a bit of getting used to. But once it does, you will have:
* Automatic tests that check whether or not your code works
* The ability to put in the values yourself
* Easy access for Mr Matheson to see your progress (and help out!)

## The work you need to do
In each of the exercises, you are writing functions. Each function needs to return a value, based on the parameters it is given. Follow the description in the ***TODO:*** comments to work out what you 
need to do, then write the code to make that happen. 

## Try it yourself, then let pytest try it for you
